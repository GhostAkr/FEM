# FEM application tests

This folder contains preloaded FEM application tests. Each file contains run-ready code and
no additional actions are required. It can be used for example by Julia debugger which runs
Julia code in a separate process instance instead of using Julia REPL. Of course this can 
also be run in Julia REPL if you want. New tests are also can be added.
